      <h2><i>Showed Leadership: </i></h2>
      <div class="d-flex pt-4 px-4  management">  <p> 
        During my junior year of high school, my lacrosse team was participating in a preseason tournament, playing against some of the teams we would be facing in the regular season. There was a particularly aggressive defender guarding me - he was committed to a Division 1 program and had a bleached mullet. He was playing a very physical, borderline dirty game.
        At one point, he leveled me with a hard, illegal hit from behind, drawing a flag from the officials. My teammates were understandably upset and wanted to retaliate.
        I intervened and told my teammates to stay calm and just keep playing our game. I didn't say anything to the defender, even though he continued to talk trash. Instead of engaging verbally, I let my play do the talking. I ended up scoring repeatedly on the aggressive defender.
        The defender's frustration boiled over, and he picked up two more personal fouls. Eventually, their best player was ejected from the game, while our team avoided any penalties. We ended up winning the game cleanly.        
        This experience taught me an important lesson - sometimes, the most effective response is to rise above the antagonism and let your actions speak for themselves. Retaliating or stooping to the other player's level would have only led to more penalties and a less disciplined performance. By maintaining my composure, I was able to beat my opponent on the scoreboard without getting drawn into his game.</p>

            As a freshman in my Management 100 class, I was part of a group of five peers tasked with researching and crafting a well-thought-out solution for Barnes & Noble. This was my first real business project, as I was still transferring into the business school.
            One of my teammates was taking charge, speaking with a lot of technical jargon, and convincing the rest of us to go with his idea. However, I was still confused about the details of his proposal.
            Given our relative inexperience, I suggested that we work on something more tangible and break down the problems into smaller, more manageable steps. My teammates resonated well with this approach.
            We ended up performing incredibly well on the project. It turned out that the grand idea my teammate had been pushing with his impressive-sounding language was essentially just a copy of Goodreads.
            In the end, we all got along really well, and I learned that it's okay to disagree with your teammates on a project. Challenging each other's ideas can actually help the team work more smoothly and arrive at a better solution.

            Last semester, I was working on a group report in my Managerial Statistics class. We were given access to various websites and databases containing a massive amount of data.
            At first, the sheer volume of information was overwhelming. However, I decided to focus on one particular data set with a lot of different data points.
            I ran correlation tables and found some incredibly interesting trends on how socioeconomic factors affect obesity, a prevalent issue in America. I was able to identify multiple factors that could tell a captivating story through the data.
            I ended up learning a lot through this data analysis process and was able to develop a compelling regression model for our group report. The in-depth exploration of this data set allowed us to present a captivating and well-supported analysis on the topic.

            In my Management Communication class, we worked closely with a startup called Ellipsis. The company wanted to be an all-in-one trip planning website with a commission-based monetization strategy.
            Ellipsis needed to acquire initial users and gather feedback to make improvements and fix bugs, in order to hopefully attract the attention of venture capital firms. However, the startup had a limited budget to work with, so we needed to help them get their initial user base established.
            Through extensive research and observations of our own campus, as well as our personal experiences, we decided to target students studying abroad at our school. These students are actively traveling and on tight budgets. We suggested commission-based ambassador programs and video competitions as ways to get these students' attention.
            The startup was incredibly receptive to our insights and decided to act upon our suggested strategies. By leveraging the specific needs and behaviors of the target student audience, we were able to provide Ellipsis with innovative and impactful recommendations to help them grow their initial user base despite their limited resources.
