      <h2 class="my-2"><i>Software Development</i></h2>
    <div class="d-flex py-4 px-4  management">
      <p>I am deeply intrigued by the field of software engineering due to its inherent potential for innovation and problem-solving. The dynamic nature of software development, coupled with its capacity to create impactful solutions, resonates with my passion for creating and making a difference. The continuous learning opportunities and collaborative environment in software engineering keep me motivated, as I thrive in environments where I can constantly challenge myself and grow. A typical day in the life of an entry-level software engineer involves participating in stand-up meetings to discuss progress and goals, coding and development tasks, collaboration with team members, testing and quality assurance, and personal skill development. My background in Math/Computer Science and Finance, along with proficiency in programming languages like Java, C, and Python, positions me as a strong candidate for this field. However, I acknowledge the need to deepen my understanding of software design patterns, algorithms, and web development frameworks. To bridge these gaps, I am committed to pursuing further education, engaging in personal projects, and seeking mentorship to enhance my skills and approach to problem-solving in software engineering.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-2 mt-4"><i>Financial advisory</i></h2>
    <div class="d-flex py-4 px-4  management">
      I am deeply intrigued by the field of financial advisory due to its potential to directly impact individuals' financial well-being and provide personalized solutions to meet their goals. A typical day for an entry-level worker in this field involves a combination of market research, client meetings, portfolio analysis, financial planning, and ongoing learning. What captivates me about this field is the opportunity to apply my analytical skills and financial acumen to help clients navigate the complexities of investment decisions and achieve financial security. The dynamic nature of financial markets ensures that there is always something new to learn and explore, keeping me motivated to continuously expand my knowledge and expertise. My academic background in finance and math/computer science, coupled with leadership experiences in sports teams and volunteer activities, positions me well for success in this field. However, I recognize the importance of gaining practical experience and refining my skills in investment analysis and client communication. To address these gaps, I am committed to pursuing internships, professional certifications, and ongoing learning opportunities to enhance my capabilities and excel in the field of financial advisory.
